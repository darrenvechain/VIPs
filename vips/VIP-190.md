# Overview

The below VIP-190 standard outlines an interface for personal sign when using `web3` to sign messages for VechainThor dApps. This standard is based on Ethereum's [eth_sign](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_sign) RPC call, and modified to fit Vechain's signature standards.

# Motivation

This standard is already in use in the Ledger Hardware Wallet application and Comet's implementation of `web3` personal sign. Standardization will ensure that dApps may support multiple clients with a single signature implementation.

# Specification

A prefix is necessary to ensure that a malicious dApp cannot sign or recover arbitrary messages. 

```
prefix = "\x19VeChain Signed Message:\n" + len(message)
```

To obtain the final payload for signature, we append the message to the prefix and hash with `blake2b256`

```
signature = sign(blake2b256(prefix + message))
```
